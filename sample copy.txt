No one like unsuccessful people. The people having different visions for SUCCESS.

Try to be successful irrespective of time, age, gender, location, environment.

Success has different meaning for different people, someone feel successful just after having a single meal a day, some people feel successful by earning money, some people feel successful after acheieving their small goals.

You might be looking people unsuccessful by your standard but they might be enjoying their success.

Success is Success, not replaceable.
